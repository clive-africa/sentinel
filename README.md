## Overview

sentinel is an  Excel-based tool designed to streamline Solvency Assessment and Management (SAM) capital calculations for South African short-term insurers. Currently implemented as an Excel workbook with VBA modules, Sentinel will be published as an Excel Add-in to provide seamless integration with existing actuarial workflows.

## Purpose

For too long the South African non-life industry, actuarial profesisonals and many insurance companies have "made do" with processes and tools that are not appropriate for the regular calcualtion of SAM capital requirements. We require proper tools to calculate regulatory capital under the SAM framework. Sentinel aims to partly addresses this need by providing:

- **Automated Capital Calculations**: Non-life capital requirement calcualtions including premiuma and reserve risk, natural catastrophe risk, factor based and non-proprotional capitla requirements
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Support for complex organizational structures and reinsurance arrangements
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built specifically for SAM requirements applicable to South African insurers
- **Efficiency**: Replaces manual calculation workbooks with automated, auditable functions
